To run your Cypress tests in the demo environment, you can use one of these commands from your terminal:
To run in headless mode:
npx cypress run --env environment='Your Environment'

To open Cypress Test Runner UI:
npx cypress open --env environment='Your Environment'

To run a specific test file in the demo environment:
npx cypress run --env environment='Your Environment' --spec "cypress/e2e/Happy Flows/formative_documents.cy.js"
The environment='Your Environemnt' parameter will make your tests use https://{Your Environment}.grantassistant.ai as the base URL instead of the default dev environment.
Make sure you're in your project's root directory when running these commands. Also ensure that you have the correct credentials set up in your 
environment variables for the demo environment if they're different from dev.
